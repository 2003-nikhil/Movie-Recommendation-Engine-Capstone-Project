Capstone Project (Netflix)

📌 Problem Statement
In the digital age, customer behavior prediction has become the cornerstone of success for businesses across various industries — from e-commerce and entertainment to finance and even politics. Recommendation Engines are a powerful application of predictive analytics that guide users towards content, products, or services tailored to their preferences, thereby improving engagement and satisfaction.

In this capstone project, we focus on building a Movie Recommendation System using user ratings and genre preferences to recommend movies most suited for each user. This system replicates the recommendation logic used by OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

🎯 Objective

📊 Identify the most popular and least liked genres

🧠 Build a model that recommends the best movie in each genre for every user

🧾 Generate insights about user interaction, genre popularity, and rating trends
